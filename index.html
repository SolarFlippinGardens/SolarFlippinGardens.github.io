				<h1>Solar Flippin' Gardens</h1>
				<p>Solar Flippin' Gardens &trade; (SFG) is a project to investigate the use of solar panels in gardens. They should not be walked on, or even remotly driven upon, they are not traffic bearing. Our panels contain sexy color chaging LED lights to create a 70s style disco effect in your garden without needing a single glitter ball. They can provide an almost straight line border from LEDs for your gardens to simulate a nicely finished edging. The shape of these panels allows for random plants to be placed at the back of the panel run to hide the gaps. Many people are shocked to learn these panels are made of crappy thin acrylic, not that nice high quality acrylic they sell on eBay. SFG panels have been tested and shown to support the weight of a cup of tea so the odd frog on the panel should be no problem. You can read more about the panel on our <a href=/Specifics.html>Specifics</a> page. We are in the very early stage of development, absolutly nothing but a bit of fun is expected to come of this project. Please feel free to contribute and waste your time and money - please don't waste other peoples money, and especially not that of the tax payer when it could go towards healthcare and education. Eventually our panels will end up in the bin, please don't make too many of them.</p>

				<p>We have zero external funding. Zip, nada, not a drop. If you want to send money for the project please give it to a charty instead (and not a US presidential charity, you know the one ;-) )</p>

				<p>We wil be able to do many wonderfull things with this technology, just don't expect to see any scientific or remotely back-of-a-fag-packet calculations as to how it might even be remotely not a chance possible.<p>

				<p>If you would like to <a href="https://github.com/SolarFlippinGardens/SolarFlippinGardens.github.io/issues">Contact Us</a> please don't bother, we won't answer your questions. Just have a moan about us on Twitter or You Tube, we love that. Ohhh, unless you want to become a customer, in which case, erm...... $$$$$$ <p>

				<p>If you would like to Contact Us regarding careers, seriously? You did an engineering degree and you want to work for us?</p>

				<p>As this incomplete buggy grammatically incorrect and full of spelling mistakes is a bit of fun and only went live in 2016 and took only a few hours to make please find our <a href="https://github.com/SolarFlippinGardens/SolarFlippinGardens.github.io">GitHub pages repository</a> and do a pull request in you have a burning desire. Cheers!<p>

			<h2>Low Maintenance:</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>No need to clear the snow off the panels, they self-heat to even maybe melt the snow.</li>
					<li>Water proof! Tested to a depth of 0.000mm these panels can take a good splashing of water (provided it hits the top surface only and not the sides).</li>
					<li>No need to cut the grass with these panels, they are ever-green (during night hours with green LEDs selected, green in no way refers to environmental credentials.)</li>
					<li>Weed free! Maybe a few bugs in the electronics, nothing will grow on these panels.</li>
					<li>During the summer your solar garden may even generate enough elecity to run a small micro-controller.</li>
